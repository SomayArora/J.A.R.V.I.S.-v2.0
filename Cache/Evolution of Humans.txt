#Header: Introduction to Evolution
#Content: Evolution explains how species change over time. Humans evolved from common ancestors with primates, driven by natural selection, genetic drift, and environmental changes.

#Slide: 3
#Header: Early Hominids
#Content: Early hominids, like Australopithecus, emerged around 4 million years ago. They walked upright, showcasing key adaptations for survival and social interaction.

#Slide: 4
#Header: Homo Species
#Content: The genus Homo appeared about 2.5 million years ago. Notable species include Homo habilis and Homo erectus, known for tool use and migration from Africa.

#Slide: 5
#Header: Neanderthals vs. Homo Sapiens
#Content: Neanderthals coexisted with early Homo sapiens. They adapted to cold climates but eventually went extinct, possibly due to competition and interbreeding.

#Slide: 6
#Header: Migration Patterns
#Content: Homo sapiens migrated out of Africa around 60,000 years ago, spreading across the globe. This led to diverse cultures and adaptations in different environments.

#Slide: 7
#Header: Cultural Evolution
#Content: With the advent of language, art, and agriculture, humans developed complex societies. This cultural evolution significantly impacted survival and social structures.

#Slide: 8
#Header: Modern Humans
#Content: Today, Homo sapiens is the sole surviving human species. Our understanding of evolution continues to evolve through genetics and archaeology, reshaping our history.
