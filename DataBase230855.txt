I do not have access to real-time information, including news updates. To get the latest news from India, I recommend checking reputable news sources such as:

. ..National News Sources:..
    . The Times of India
    . The Hindu
    . Hindustan Times
    . The Indian Express
    . NDTV
    . BBC News India
    . CNN-News18
. ..International News Sources:..
    . BBC News
    . The New York Times
    . Al Jazeera
    . Reuters
    . Associated Press
. ..Regional News Sources:..
    . There are many regional news sources available in India. You can find these by searching online for "news in [state name]" or "news in [city name]" 

You can also use news aggregators like Google News or Apple News to get a quick overview of the top stories.
