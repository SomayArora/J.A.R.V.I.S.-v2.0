To set the volume to 100% using the command line on Linux, Windows, and macOS, here are the key commands for each operating system:

### Linux

On most Linux distributions, you can use the `amixer` command:

```
amixer sset Master 100%
```

Alternatively, you can use `alsamixer`:

```
alsamixer
```

Then press F6 to switch to the master channel and use the arrow keys to increase the volume to 100%.

### Windows

On Windows, you can use PowerShell:

```
Set-AudioDevice -Name "Default Device" -Volume 100
```

Or use the `wmic` command:

```
wmic audio device get name,deviceid
wmic path win32_volume set Caption="Volume Level: 100%"
```

### macOS

On macOS, you can use the `osascript` command:

```
osascript -e 'set volume output volume 100'
```

### General Tips

- Replace "Master" with the specific audio channel name if needed (e.g., "Headphone", "Line").
- Some systems may require root/sudo privileges to modify volume levels.
- The exact syntax might vary slightly depending on your specific system configuration.
- On some systems, you may need to install additional packages or tools to use these commands.

Remember to adjust the command based on your specific audio setup and preferences. These commands should work on most modern versions of Linux, Windows, and macOS, but the exact syntax might differ slightly depending on your system configuration.
